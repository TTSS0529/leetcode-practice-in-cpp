## üî∏ Biweekly Contest 161 (2025-07-19)

- **Solved**: 2 / 4  
- **Score**: 8  
- **Rank**: 9557
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Second contest

### üìò Summary

| # | Title | Status | Notes |
|:--:|:------|:--------|:------|
| 3618 | [Split Array By Prime Indices](./cpp/math/3618_split_array_by_prime_indices/) | ‚úÖ | Array splitting based on prime indices, optimized with sieve |
| 3619 | [Count Islands With Total Value Divisible By K](./cpp/flood_fill_connected_components/3619_count_islands_with_total_value_divisible_by_k/) | ‚úÖ | Flood fill via DFS and BFS comparison |

### üß† Lessons Learned
- Reinforced the **Sieve of Eratosthenes** to efficiently handle prime checks in \(O(n \log \log n)\), avoiding the naive \(O(n \sqrt{n})\) approach.
- Practiced **grid flood fill (DFS vs BFS)**, confirming DFS is faster on typical LeetCode constraints due to better cache locality and less queue overhead.

## üî∏ Biweekly Contest 160 (2025-07-05)

- **Solved**: 2 / 4  
- **Score**: 8  
- **Rank**: 8096  
- **Status**: ‚úÖ First-ever contest

### üìò Summary

| # | Title | Status | Notes |
|:--:|:------|:--------|:------|
| 3602 | [Hexadecimal And Hexatrigesimal Conversion](./cpp/simulation/3602_hexadecimal_and_hexatrigesimal_conversion/) | ‚úÖ | Base Conversion |
| 3603 | [Minimum Cost Path With Alternating Directions II](./cpp/dynamic_programming/3603_minimum_cost_path_with_alternating_direction_ii/) | ‚úÖ | Grid DP with custom movement rule |
| 3604 | Minimum Time To Reach Destination In Directed Graph | ‚ùå | To revisit (BFS with time constraints) |
| 3605 | Minimum Stability Factor Of Array | ‚ùå | To revisit (GCD + sliding window) |

### üß† Lessons Learned
- Practice high-base conversion logic and corner case handling  
- Learn how to model cost alternation using dynamic programming on grids  
- Reinforce BFS with time-constrained edge usage and (node, time) state  
- Study how to combine GCD with sliding window and binary search  
- Improve overall graph modeling and state design skills
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Problems 3604 and 3605 involve advanced algorithmic concepts such as BFS with time constraints and number theory techniques (GCD combined with sliding window and binary search). Due to the current limited familiarity with these topics, I have decided to temporarily set these problems aside. I plan to revisit and solve them after further strengthening my foundational knowledge in graph algorithms and number theory.
