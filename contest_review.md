### 📘 Summary

| # | Title | Status | Notes |
|:--:|:------|:--------|:------|
| 3602 | [Hexadecimal And Hexatrigesimal Conversion](./cpp/simulation/3602_hexadecimal_and_hexatrigesimal_conversion/) | ✅ | Base Conversion |
| 3603 | Minimum Cost Path With Alternating Directions II | ✅ | Dijkstra with alternating steps |
| 3604 | Minimum Time To Reach Destination In Directed Graph | ❌ | To revisit (BFS with time constraints) |
| 3605 | Minimum Stability Factor Of Array | ❌ | To revisit (GCD + sliding window) |

### 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Practice high-base conversion logic and corner case handling  
- Learn Dijkstra-style traversal with alternating rules (e.g., even/odd steps)  
- Reinforce BFS with time-constrained edge usage and (node, time) state  
- Study how to combine GCD with sliding window and binary search  
- Improve overall graph modeling and state design skills
