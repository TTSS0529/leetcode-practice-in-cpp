# 3635 - Earliest Finish Time for Land and Water Rides II

## üß† Idea

This problem requires finding the earliest possible time to finish exactly one land ride and one water ride, taken in either order, similar to problem 3633 but with larger input sizes.

The key insight is to use a **greedy approach** leveraging the minimum finish times of rides in each category:

- Compute the earliest finish time among all land rides:  
  `minLand = min(landStartTime[i] + landDuration[i])`

- Then, for each water ride, calculate the finish time if the water ride is taken after the earliest finishing land ride:  
  `max(minLand, waterStartTime[j]) + waterDuration[j]`

- Similarly, compute the earliest finish time among all water rides:  
  `minWater = min(waterStartTime[j] + waterDuration[j])`

- For each land ride, calculate the finish time if the land ride is taken after the earliest finishing water ride:  
  `max(minWater, landStartTime[i]) + landDuration[i]`

The final answer is the minimum among all these calculated finish times.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Points

- Instead of enumerating all pairs (which is \(O(nm)\) and too slow for large inputs), use **greedy minimization** by focusing on earliest finishing rides from each category.
- Use `max()` to simulate waiting times when switching rides.
- The approach runs efficiently in **linear time** relative to input size.
- This method implicitly considers both possible ride orders.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity

- **Time:** \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) and \(m\) are the number of land and water rides respectively.
- **Space:** \(O(1)\)
