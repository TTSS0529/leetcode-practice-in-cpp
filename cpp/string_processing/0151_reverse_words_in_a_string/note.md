# 0151 - Reverse Words in a String

### üß† Idea  
Reverse the order of words in a string, removing extra spaces.  
Two approaches:
- **Brute-force**: scan from the end of the string using `substr` to extract words and build the result step by step.
- **Optimized**: same logic, but use `reserve()` to preallocate memory for the result string to avoid repeated reallocations during concatenation.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Points  
- Both methods scan from the end toward the beginning of the string.
- Instead of splitting the whole string, words are extracted one at a time (‚Äúlazy extraction‚Äù).
- This is not a traditional two-pointer technique, but a **range-based backward scan** using character search functions (`find_last_of`, `find_last_not_of`).
- Optimized version improves performance by calling `result.reserve(s.size())` to prevent repeated memory allocation.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity  
- Brute-force:  
  - Time: O(n¬≤) in worst case (due to repeated reallocations)  
  - Space: O(n)  
- Optimized (with `reserve`):  
  - Time: O(n)  
  - Space: O(n)
