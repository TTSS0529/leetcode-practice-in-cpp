# 0108 - Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree

## üß† Idea

We are asked to convert a **sorted array** into a **height-balanced Binary Search Tree (BST)**.

Key properties:
- The input array is sorted in **ascending order**.  
- A height-balanced BST means for every node, the **left and right subtrees‚Äô height differ by at most 1**.  
- To achieve balance, we should always pick the **middle element** of the current subarray as the root.  

This naturally suggests a **Divide & Conquer** + **Recursion** approach.

## üîÅ Step-by-step

1. **Pick the middle element** of the array/subarray as the root node.  
   - This ensures roughly equal numbers of nodes in the left and right subtrees.  
2. **Recursively construct**:  
   - Left subtree from the left half (`left ‚Üí mid-1`).  
   - Right subtree from the right half (`mid+1 ‚Üí right`).  
3. Base case: if `left > right`, return `nullptr`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Points

- Picking the middle guarantees the BST is **balanced**.  
- Each recursive call reduces the problem size by ~half.  
- This is a typical **Divide & Conquer** pattern.  
- Implementation detail: use `mid = left + (right - left) / 2` to avoid integer overflow.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n)` ‚Üí every element is visited once to create a node.  
- **Space:**  
  - `O(h)` recursion stack, where `h` is tree height.  
  - Balanced BST ‚Üí `h ‚âà log n`.
