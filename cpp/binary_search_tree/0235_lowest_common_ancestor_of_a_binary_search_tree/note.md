# 0235 - Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

### üß† Idea  
Take advantage of the **Binary Search Tree (BST)** property:  
- All nodes in the left subtree are smaller than the root.  
- All nodes in the right subtree are larger than the root.

We traverse the tree from the root:
- If both `p` and `q` are **smaller** than `root`, go **left**.
- If both are **greater**, go **right**.
- Otherwise, we have found the **split point**, i.e., the Lowest Common Ancestor.

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Points  
- Unlike the general binary tree LCA approach, this one **doesn't require post-order traversal**.  
- Leverages the BST's ordering to avoid visiting unnecessary nodes.  
- Iterative or recursive solution both work well.  
- Return the first node where `p` and `q` no longer lie on the same side.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity  
- **Time**: O(H)  
  - `H` is the height of the tree.  
  - O(log n) for balanced BST, O(n) for skewed trees.  
- **Space**:  
  - Recursive: O(H) stack space  
  - Iterative: O(1)
