# 0048 - Rotate Image

### üß† Idea  
Rotate the matrix **90 degrees clockwise** by performing two in-place operations:

1. **Transpose** the matrix over its main diagonal  
2. **Reverse each row** horizontally

This method avoids using extra space and cleanly decomposes the rotation into two simple steps.

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Points  
- Transposition swaps `matrix[i][j]` with `matrix[j][i]` for `i > j`.
- Row reversal swaps elements on both ends moving inward.
- Both operations are done **in-place**, so no extra memory is required.
- Avoids unnecessary rotations or copying by directly transforming the matrix structure.
