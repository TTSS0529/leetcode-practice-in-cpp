# 0310 - Minimum Height Trees  

## üß† Idea  

We are asked to find all **roots of Minimum Height Trees (MHTs)** in an undirected graph with `n` nodes.  

**Key insights:**  
- The **root(s) of MHT** are always the **center(s) of the tree**.  
- A tree can have **1 or 2 centers**.  
- The problem reduces to **finding the tree‚Äôs centroid(s)**.  

We achieve this by **iteratively trimming leaf nodes** until only 1‚Äì2 nodes remain.

## üîÅ Step-by-step  

1. **Build graph** using adjacency list and track `degree[i]` for each node.  
2. **Initialize queue** with all current leaf nodes (`degree[i] == 1`).  
3. While `remain > 2`:  
   - Remove all current leaves (`sz = q.size()`).  
   - For each removed leaf, decrement its neighbors‚Äô degree.  
   - If a neighbor becomes a new leaf, push it into the queue.  
   - Update `remain -= sz`.  
4. The **remaining nodes (1‚Äì2)** are the MHT roots.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Points  

- **Leaves trimming:** similar to **topological sort**.  
- **Why stop at 2 nodes?**  
  - A tree‚Äôs center is either 1 node (odd diameter) or 2 nodes (even diameter).  
- **Efficiency:** each edge is processed only once.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity  

- **Time:** `O(n)` ‚Äî each node and edge is visited at most once.  
- **Space:** `O(n)` ‚Äî adjacency list, degree array, and queue.
