# 3618 - Split Array by Prime Indices

---

## ‚úÖ Version 1: Naive Prime Check (`isPrime` function)

### üß† Idea  
Check for each index whether it is prime using a straightforward `isPrime` function:  
- For each `num`, check divisibility from 2 up to `‚àönum`.  
- If prime, add `nums[i]` to sum A, else to sum B.  
- Return the absolute difference.

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Points  
- Simple implementation, easy to understand and write quickly in contests.  
- Each prime check costs up to \(O(\sqrt{n})\), done for each index ‚Üí total \(O(n \sqrt{n})\).  
- Suffers from performance issues for large arrays.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity  
- Time: \(O(n \sqrt{n})\)  
- Space: \(O(1)\)

## ‚úÖ Version 2: Optimized Sieve of Eratosthenes

### üß† Idea  
Precompute primality of all indices in one pass using the Sieve of Eratosthenes:  
- Create a boolean vector `primeState` initialized as true for all indices except 0 and 1.  
- Mark multiples of each prime starting from 2 as non-prime.  
- After sieve, split sums by checking `primeState[i]`.  
- Return the absolute difference.

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Points  
- Single sieve precomputation reduces repeated prime checks.  
- Time complexity improves drastically to \(O(n \log \log n)\).  
- Uses extra space proportional to array length for the sieve.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity  
- Time: \(O(n \log \log n)\)  
- Space: \(O(n)\)
