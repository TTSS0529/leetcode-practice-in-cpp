## âœ… Solution Comparison

| Aspect           | Iterative Implementation                        | Recursive Implementation                        |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Approach**      | Use a dummy head and a tail pointer to build list step by step | Solve subproblems recursively, merge and return |
| **Code Length**   | Slightly longer but clearer logic               | Shorter and more intuitive                      |
| **Time Complexity** | O(m + n) where m and n are lengths of the two lists | O(m + n)                                     |
| **Space Complexity** | O(1), in-place merge without extra memory     | O(m + n) due to recursive call stack            |
| **Stability**      | Stable and handles long lists well              | Risk of stack overflow on long lists            |
| **Extensibility**  | Easy to add extra logic, like deduplication or counting | Readable but less flexible for customization    |
