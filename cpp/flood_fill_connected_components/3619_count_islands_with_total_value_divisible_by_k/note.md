# 3619 - Count Islands With Total Value Divisible by K  

### üß† Idea  
This is a classic **flood-fill problem** on a grid:  

- An **island** is a connected component of non-zero cells (4-directionally connected).  
- We need to compute the **sum of all cells** in each island and check if it‚Äôs divisible by `k`.  

We can traverse islands using:  
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)** ‚Üí recursively explore each island.  
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** ‚Üí iteratively explore using a queue.

## ‚úÖ Method 1 - DFS (Recursive Flood Fill)

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Points  
- If `grid[i][j] > 0`, start DFS from this cell.  
- Add its value to the running sum, then mark it as visited (`grid[i][j] = 0`).  
- Recursively visit its 4 neighbors.  
- After DFS finishes, check `sum % k == 0` to count valid islands.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity  
- **Time**: O(m √ó n), each cell visited once.  
- **Space**: O(m √ó n) worst-case recursion stack (but usually much smaller).  

---

## ‚úÖ Method 2 - BFS (Queue-Based Flood Fill)

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Points  
- If `grid[i][j] > 0`, push it into a queue.  
- While queue not empty, pop a cell, add its value, and push unvisited neighbors.  
- Mark visited cells as `0` to avoid revisiting.  
- After BFS finishes, check `sum % k == 0`.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity  
- **Time**: O(m √ó n), same as DFS.  
- **Space**: O(m √ó n) for queue in the worst case.
