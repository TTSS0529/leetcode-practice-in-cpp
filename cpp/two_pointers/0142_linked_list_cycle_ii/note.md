# 0142 - Linked List Cycle II

### üß† Idea  
Two approaches to find the **start of a cycle in a linked list**:  
- **Brute-force**: store visited nodes in a hash set, and return the first one that repeats.  
- **Optimized**: use Floyd‚Äôs Cycle Detection (fast & slow pointers) to detect the cycle and locate its entry point.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Points  
- Brute-force is simple but uses extra memory.  
- Optimized method is space-efficient and based on pointer movement math.  
- Fast pointer moves 2 steps, slow 1 step. When they meet, restart one at head‚Äîmeeting point is cycle start.  
- Works only on singly linked lists with possible cycles.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity  
- Brute-force:  
  - Time: O(n)  
  - Space: O(n)  
- Optimized:  
  - Time: O(n)  
  - Space: O(1)
