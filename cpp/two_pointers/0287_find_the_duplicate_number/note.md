# 0287 - Find the Duplicate Number

### üß† Idea  
We aim to find **the only duplicated number** in an array of size `n + 1`, with all values in the range `[1, n]`.

Two efficient solutions exist:  
- **Cycle Detection (Floyd‚Äôs Tortoise and Hare)**: Model the array as a linked list where `nums[i]` is the next pointer.  
- **Binary Search on Value Range**: Use the pigeonhole principle and count how many numbers are ‚â§ mid.

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Points  

#### üê¢ Cycle Detection (Floyd)  
- Treat `nums[i]` as a pointer to the next node.  
- Since a duplicate creates a loop, we can detect a cycle and find its entry point.  
- First phase: use fast/slow pointers to find a meeting point.  
- Second phase: restart one pointer from index 0, the meeting point is the duplicate.

#### üîç Binary Search on Value Range  
- Binary search on value range `[1, n]`, not indices.  
- Count how many numbers are ‚â§ `mid`.  
- If `count > mid`, the duplicate lies in the left half.  
- Relies on pigeonhole principle: more than `mid` elements in range `[1, mid]` ‚Üí duplicate must exist.

| Method              | Time            | Space   | Notes                          |
|---------------------|------------------|---------|---------------------------------|
| Floyd Cycle Detect  | `O(n)`          | `O(1)`  | Fastest runtime (~70%)         |
| Binary Search       | `O(n log n)`    | `O(1)`  | More readable but a bit slower |
