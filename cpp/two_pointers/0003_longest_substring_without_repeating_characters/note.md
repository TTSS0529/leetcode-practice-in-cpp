# 0003 - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

### üß† Idea  
Three approaches to find the **length of the longest substring without repeating characters**:  
- **Brute-force**: Try every start index and expand the substring until a duplicate is found.  
- **Sliding Window + Hash Map**: Use a hash map to track the last seen position of each character.  
- **Sliding Window + Fixed Array**: Replace map with an ASCII array for better performance.

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Points  
- Brute-force is easy to implement but has O(n¬≤) time complexity.  
- Hash map version improves performance to O(n), suitable for any character set.  
- Array version is the fastest if input is ASCII-only (256 chars), with better cache efficiency.  
- `i` represents the **left bound** of the valid window, `j` is the right bound (inclusive).

### ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity  
- Brute-force:  
  - Time: O(n¬≤)  
  - Space: O(1)  
- Map-based sliding window:  
  - Time: O(n)  
  - Space: O(n)  
- Array-based sliding window:  
  - Time: O(n)  
  - Space: O(1) (fixed 256 size)
