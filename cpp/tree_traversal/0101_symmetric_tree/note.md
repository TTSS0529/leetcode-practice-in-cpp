# 0101 - Symmetric Tree

### üß† Idea  
Two common approaches to **check if a binary tree is symmetric (mirror of itself)**:  
- **DFS (Recursive)**: Recursively compare `left->left` with `right->right` and `left->right` with `right->left`.  
- **BFS (Iterative)**: Use a queue to compare nodes in pairs level by level.  

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Points  
- DFS recursion is concise and naturally fits the mirror comparison.  
- BFS avoids recursion stack and is safer for very deep trees.  
- Both approaches always **compare nodes in symmetric positions**.  
- If at any point one node is `null` and the other isn‚Äôt (or values differ) ‚Üí **not symmetric**.  

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity  
- **Time**: O(n), where n = number of nodes (visit each node once).  
- **Space**:  
  - DFS: O(h) recursion stack (h = tree height, worst case O(n) for skewed tree).  
  - BFS: O(w) queue (w = max width of the tree).
