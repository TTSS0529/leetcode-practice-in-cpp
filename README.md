# leetcode-practice-in-cpp
This repository is for my personal LeetCode practice using mainly C++. 

## 🎯 Training Goal

My initial target is to solve **one problem per day**. If I miss any problems during the weekdays, I will catch up on them over the weekend.(to be continued...)

# 🚀 LeetCode Training Progress

- 📅 Start Date: 2025-06-09
- ✅ Total Problems Solved: **4/7(week one)**  
- 📈 Difficulty Breakdown: Easy(2) / Medium(2) / Hard(0) / Total(4)  
- 🧠 Topics Covered: Linked List, Array, Dynamic Programming, Stack, etc.

## 📋 Problem Overview (Click to view problem or solution folder)

### 📁 Folder Structure & Usage

Each problem is placed in its own folder, which contains:

- A `.hpp` header file for declarations  
- A `test.cpp` file for testing all versions  
- Multiple `.cpp` files, each representing a different version of the solution  

To compile, just compile any solution `.cpp` together with `test.cpp`.

Example:
c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror brute_force.cpp test.cpp -o test && ./test

📌 If a problem folder only contains a brute_force version, that means the first try already hit 100% runtime, so I haven’t optimized it further (yet). I’ll revisit it if I come up with a better idea.
